# Social-Network-Ads-Result-Analysis


The "Social Network Ads Result Analysis" project is a data-driven initiative designed to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of social network advertisements with respect to the age, estimated salary, and purchase behavior of users.

This project leverages advanced data analytics and visualization techniques to help businesses and marketers optimize their advertising campaigns on social media platforms. By examining user demographics (age), financial indicators (estimated salary), and their purchase decisions, the project aims to answer critical questions such as:

1. Which age groups are most responsive to our social network ads?
2. How does an estimated salary influence the likelihood of making a purchase after viewing an ad?
3. What are the trends in ad performance across different demographic segments?
